## Troubleshooting

**Q: I created a webinar but users don't see it**
A: Check if it's "Published" (not Draft). Click the toggle in the Webinars tab.

**Q: The dates/times look wrong**
A: Verify your timezone. Times should be in 24-hour format (14:00 not 2 PM in the system). Users see them in readable format.

**Q: Can I change the webinar after publishing?**
A: Yes! Click Edit, change the details, and save. Booking slots automatically update.

**Q: What if a participant can't attend?**
A: They can book another time slot if available. Or contact you directly.

**Q: Can I offer the same webinar multiple times?**
A: Yes! Create one webinar with multiple dates/times, or create separate webinars with different themes.
